## Terraform Module - Kratix | 🚀🚀🚀 
Kratix is an open-source framework that enables platform engineers to build flexible and curated internal platforms. It provides a clear contract between application and platform teams through the definition and creation of paved path abstractions defined as “Promises”. Using the GitOps workflow and Kubernetes-native constructs, Kratix empowers platform teams to offer the self-service capabilities that developers need whilst also keeping the platform up-to-date and secured

🎯 Key Features of Kratix
```
✅ Profile:
Platform engineers can reduce complexity and increase developer productivity by providing the right abstraction levels, defined as “Promises”. A promise can encode any capability such as CI as-a-service, data services, or a full development environment, and can be offered on demand, at scale, across an organization.

✅ Focus:
Kratix focuses on the platform engineer experience of building better platforms, unlike other frameworks and platforms which focus exclusively on application-developer experience. By using Kubernetes as the building block, Kratix encompasses the power and flexibility of raw Kubernetes and enables platform teams to curate an API-driven, bespoke platform that meets specific organizational needs and can evolve as those needs change.

✅ Background:
Kubernetes is a platform for building platforms and has become the ubiquitous infrastructure abstraction layer. Whilst there has been an increase in managed Kubernetes distributions and “off-the-shelf” developer platforms, Kratix has been developed to make it easier for platform engineers to build their own curated platforms on top of Kubernetes.
